<p class="lead">Hi, this is <strong>my site <a href="https://danieletabellini.com">danieletabellini.com</a></strong>

In accordance with articles 13 and 14 of EU Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) I want to provide you with simple and clear information on how I process your personal data which **you provide to me directly or which I may in any case come into possession of while browsing the site**.

## Legal basis and purpose of processing
{% icon "privacy:finalita-del-trattamento" '{ "aria-hidden": "true" }'  %} 

</div>

**On this website I present a summary of my work as an artist and designer**, also for the purpose of documenting my activities as a freelancer.

**On this website I publish without regularity information relating to the projects in which I have been or am involved** (only if the information is freely disclosed, already publicly available or I have obtained explicit consent to publish it e.g. from a clause in a professional service contract); links to useful resources for learning more about topics of interest; links to my social media profiles (LinkedIN, X, GitHub and Mastodon); in-depth articles for dissemination purposes.

**When creating the site's software I tried to implement a "by design" approach to privacy**: trying not to collect any type of personal data, also choosing (or writing) where possible software solutions that respect privacy "by default"; to minimize the data collected as much as possible if this is not possible, for example for technical data collected by hosting servers; to use open source software solutions that guaranteed transparency and the possibility of verifying the algorithms.

Personally I don't like the so-called "Cookie banners" or the consents collected once and recorded "For all similar contents" by third-party platforms, therefore where I integrate or will integrate in-depth video content (e.g. interviews, tutorials, recordings from participation in events ) from the third-party platform YouTube, **I will ask you the explicit consent for each individual video** (following the paragraph "Video from YouTube"), otherwise avoiding you any contact with YouTube cookies or technical software.

### Icons

The icons I use to mark the main sections of this privacy policy are part of the complete set created by **Maastricht European Center on Privacy and Cybersecurity – ECPC** (distributed under [CC BY 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en)) for the project [Informative chiare](https://www.garanteprivacy.it/temi/informativechiare) (italian language) of the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante per la protezione dei dati personali). The only exception is the "Cookies" icon which I created in style. 

On the accessibility side, all the icons on this page are made invisible to screen readers using the `aria-hidden="false"` attribute because they represent the concept expressed by the same heading that precedes them.

### License and source

I wrote the text of this privacy policy taking inspiration from [that of the website designers.italia.it](https://designers.italia.it/privacy-policy/) (distributed with [CC BY-SA 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en)), which it therefore inherits.

This website **danieletabellini.com is my personal site, and is absolutely not part of the Designers Italia project**. I, Daniele Tabellini, am solely responsible for the contents of this policy for the danieletabellini.com website should it contain any inaccuracies or inconsistencies. I am obviously not responsible for anyone who might be inspired by this to write others for other websites.

In any case, before getting angry, contact me at the addresses indicated above in the [The data controller](#data-controller) section, I am always available to correct, amend and integrate: **the web has a "human" future only with open projects approached with a view to continuous improvement, there are no finished or perfect websites to be certified, there are websites that we can take care of and improve to create or cultivate relationships and human qualities**.

Finally, the source of this website is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Fupete/danieletabellini/) under an open license. **If you want to help me improve it, messages and reports on privacy and accessibility are welcome, use the links below.**
