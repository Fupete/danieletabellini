# Ciao

This could be the repository for my/our new upcoming portfolio and digital playground. Let's see. 

The code is originally based on this 11ty + Vite starter project: https://github.com/matthiasott/eleventy-plus-vite

## Getting started

Start by [generating a new repository based on this project](https://github.com/matthiasott/eleventy-plus-vite/generate).

After cloning (or downloading) the repository to your local machine, install all dependencies with the command

```sh
npm install
```

## Run dev server

The project comes with Eleventyâ€™s built-in development server. You can start the server with

```sh
npm start
````

or

```sh
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
````


## Build

To trigger a production build, use

```sh
npm run build
````

or

```sh
npx @11ty/eleventy
```
